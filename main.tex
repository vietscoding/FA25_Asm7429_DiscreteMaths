\section*{Introduction}
Mathematics is the foundation of the fields of software engineering and information technology (IT), where discrete mathematics plays an important role in solving complex computational problems. Discrete mathematics, which includes fields such as set theory, graph theory, Boolean algebra, and abstract algebra, equips software engineers with the tools to design efficient algorithms, model data structures, and ensure robust system performance. For example, concepts from discrete mathematics are integral to database query optimization, cryptographic protocols, network routing algorithms, and logic circuit design, enabling practical solutions to real-world challenges (Rosen, 2018).

The application of discrete mathematics in software engineering offers significant benefits. It allows developers to create optimized algorithms with improved time and space complexity, as seen in sorting and searching techniques. Furthermore, discrete structures such as graphs facilitate the modeling of relationships in social networks or communication systems. At the same time, Boolean algebra supports the development of reliable digital circuits, and abstract algebra helps understand symmetries in computational problems (Epp, 2010). By mastering these concepts, engineers can solve complex problems of accuracy and scalability. This assignment explores the practical applications of discrete mathematics in software engineering through a structured analysis organized into four chapters.

In this assignment
\begin{itemize}
  \item the symbol $\overline{9b}$ denotes a two-digit natural number,
  \item the symbol $\overline{12a}$ represents a three-digit natural number.
\end{itemize}

For example, if $a=3$, then $\overline{12a} = 123$.

For each student, replace a and b with specific numerical values to obtain the final result.

According to the requirement above, I need to address problems in this assignment using my ID, which is BD00536. $a$ and $b$ ($a < b$) represents the two largest numbers in my ID, so $a$ = 5 and $b$ = 6.

I will address the issues listed below in the respective subsections in this Section:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Let $A$ and $B$ be two non-empty finite sets. Assume that cardinalities of the sets $A$, $B$, and $A \cap B$ are $\overline{9b}$, $\overline{2a}$, and $a + b$, respectively. Determine the cardinality of set $A \cup B$.
  \item Suppose $|A-B|=\overline{3a}$, $|A \cup B|=\overline {11b}$, and $|A \cap B|=\overline{1a}$. Determine $|B|$.
  \item At a local market, there are $\overline {35b}$ customers. Suppose $\overline {11a}$ have purchased fruits, $\overline {9b}$ have purchased vegetables, $\overline {8a}$ have purchased bakery items, $\overline{4b}$ have purchased both fruits and vegetables, $\overline{3b}$ have purchased both vegetables and bakery items, $\overline{2a}$ have purchased both fruits and bakery items, and $\overline{1a}$ have purchased all three categories. How many customers have not purchased anything?
\end{itemize}

In the following subsections I will address these issues and along the way use a = 5 and b = 6 as the two largest digits in my ID to demonstrate.


\subsection{Determine the cardinality of set $A \cup B$}
\subsubsection*{The Problem:}

  Let $A$ and $B$ be two non-empty finite sets. Assume that cardinalities of the sets $A$, $B$, and $A \cap B$ are $\overline{9b}$, $\overline{2a}$, and $a + b$, respectively. Determine the cardinality of set $A \cup B$.

  To solve this problem, I need to determine the cardinality of the set $A \cup B$, based on the given information about the cardinalities of the sets $A$, $B$, and $A \cap B$. Here is the detailed solution:

\subsubsection*{Given:}
  Using \(a = 5\) and \(b = 6\) from my ID (BD00536), the cardinalities are computed as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The cardinality of set \(A\) is \(\overline{9b} = 96\).
    \item The cardinality of set \(B\) is \(\overline{2a} = 25\).
    \item The cardinality of set \(A \cap B\) is \(a + b = 5 + 6 = 11\).
  \end{itemize}
  I need to find the cardinality of the set \(A \cup B\).

\subsubsection*{Formula:}
  The cardinality of the union of two sets is given by the inclusion-exclusion principle:
  \[
  |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
  \]

\subsubsection*{Substitution:}
  Substituting the given values into the formula:
  \[
  |A \cup B| = 96 + 25 - 11
  \]

  Calculating step-by-step:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item 96 + 25 = 121
    \item 121 - 11 = 110
  \end{enumerate}


  Thus, the cardinality of the set \( A \cup B \) is:
  \[
  |A \cup B| = 110
  \]

\subsubsection*{Verification:}
  To ensure the result is correct, I check the conditions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \( |A \cap B| = 11 \), meaning the intersection \( A \cap B \) has 11 elements.
  \item Since \( |A \cap B| \leq |A| \) and \( |A \cap B| \leq |B| \), we have \( 11 \leq 96 \) and \( 11 \leq 25 \), both of which are satisfied.
  \item The sets \( A \) and \( B \) are non-empty and finite, which aligns with the assumptions.
\end{itemize}


Therefore, there are no contradictions, and the calculation is valid.

\subsubsection*{Conclusion:}
The cardinality of the set \( A \cup B \) is $\boxed{110}$.


\subsection{Determine $| B |$}

\subsubsection*{The Problem:}
  Suppose $|A-B|=\overline{3a}$, $|A \cup B|=\overline {11b}$, and $|A \cap B|=\overline{1a}$. Determine $|B|$.

\subsubsection*{Given:}
  Using \(a = 5\) and \(b = 6\) from my ID (BD00536), and based on the given problem we have the following data:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\vert A - B \vert = \overline{3a} = 35$
    \item $\vert A \cup B \vert = \overline{11b} = 116$
    \item $\vert A \cap B \vert = \overline{1a} = 15$
  \end{itemize}
  Let's determine $|B|$

\subsubsection*{Formula:}
  I will use the \textbf{principle of inclusion-exclusion} to determine $|B|$:
    \[
    |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \tag{1}
    \]

\subsubsection*{Substitution:}
  \[
  116 = |A| + |B| - 15.
  \]
  \[
  |A| + |B| = 116 + 15 = 131. \tag{2}
  \]

  For \( |A - B| \):
  \[
  |A - B| = |A| - |A \cap B|.
  \]

  \[
  35 = |A| - 15.
  \]

  \[
  |A| = 35 + 15 = 50.
  \]

  Substitute \( |A| = 50 \) into equation (2):
  \[
  50 + |B| = 131.
  \]

  \[
  |B| = 131 - 50 = 81.
  \]

\subsubsection*{Verification:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $|A|=50, |B|=81,|A\cap B|=15.$
    \item Check: $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| = 50 + 81 - 15 = 116$, which matches.
    \item Check: $|A - B| = |A| - |A \cap B| = 50 - 15 = 35$, which matches.
  \end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Conclusion:}
Final answer: \boxed{81}

\subsection{How many customers have not purchased anything?}

\subsubsection*{The Problem:}
At a local market, there are $\overline {35b}$ customers. Suppose $\overline {11a}$ have purchased fruits, $\overline {9b}$ have purchased vegetables, $\overline {8a}$ have purchased bakery items, $\overline{4b}$ have purchased both fruits and vegetables, $\overline{3b}$ have purchased both vegetables and bakery items, $\overline{2a}$ have purchased both fruits and bakery items, and $\overline{1a}$ have purchased all three categories. How many customers have not purchased anything?
\subsubsection*{Given:}
  Using \(a = 5\) and \(b = 6\) from my ID (BD00536), and based on the given problem we have the following data:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item There are $\overline{35b} = 356$ customers:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $\overline{11a} = 115$ have purchased fruits.
      \item $\overline{9b} = 96$ have purchased vegetables.
      \item $\overline{8a} = 85$ have purchased bakery items.
      \item $\overline{4b} = 46$ have purchased both fruits and vegetables.
      \item $\overline{3b} = 36$ have purchased both vegetables and bakery items.
      \item $\overline{2a} = 25$ have purchased both fruits and bakery items.
      \item $\overline{1a} = 15$ have purchased all three categories.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Let:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $U$ be the set of all customers.
      \item $A$ is the set of customers who bought fruits.
      \item $B$ is the set of customers who bought vegetables.
      \item $C$ is the set of customers who bought bakery items.
      \item $D$ is the set of customers who bought all there categories.
      \item $E$ is the set of customers who bought nothing.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Based on the given data, we refine the above data to support solving the problem in a simpler way by using the concepts of sets and we will use these facts to find the number of customers who bought nothing:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $|U| = 356$
      \item $|A| = 115$
      \item $|B| = 96$
      \item $|C| = 85$
      \item $|A \cap B| = 46$
      \item $|B \cap C| = 36$
      \item $|A \cap C| = 25$
      \item $|D| = |A \cup B \cup C| = 15$
      \item $|E|$?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Formula:}
  We can get \textbf{the number of customers who bought nothing ($|E|$)} by subtracting \textbf{the number of customers who bought at least one category ($|D|$)} from the \textbf{total number of customers ($|U|$)}, which means:
  \[
  |E| = |U| - |D|
  \]
  or 
  \[
  |E| = |U| - |A \cup B \cup C| \tag{1}
  \]

  I will use the \textbf{principle of inclusion-exclusion} for three sets to determine the number of customers who bought nothing at the store, which is |E|:
    \[
    |A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B|+|C| - |A \cap B| - |B \cap C| - |A \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C| \tag{2}
    \]

\subsubsection*{Substitution:}
  Substitute the data we have in the given part into equation (2), we have:
  \[
  |D| = |A \cup B \cup C| = 115 + 96 + 85 - 46 - 36 - 25 + 15 = 204
  \]

  Substitute $|D|$ we just got above and $|U|$ into the equation (1) to find $|E|$, we have:
  \[
  |E| = 356 - 204 = 152
  \]



\subsubsection*{Verification:}
To confirm the union calculation step-by-step:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Sum of individual sets: $115 + 96 + 85 = 296$
  \item Subtract pairwise intersections: $296 - 46 - 36 - 25 = 296 - 107 = 189$
  \item Add back the triple intersection: $189 + 15 = 204$

\end{itemize}
This matches the result I did above, so the number of customers who purchased nothing is indeed 152.


\subsubsection*{Conclusion:}
The number of customers who have not purchased anything is \boxed{152}.
